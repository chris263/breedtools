#' Generate an augmented p-rep design
#'
#' Creates a multi-location augmented partially replicated (p-rep) design
#' (Williams, Piepho and Whitaker, 2011). Instead of replicated checks, a
#' subset of the test entries is replicated at each location: every entry is
#' planted once at every location, and the entries chosen for p-rep at a
#' location get extra plots there. All plots of a location are arranged in
#' incomplete blocks, chosen so that pairs of entries share a block at most
#' once across the whole trial ((0,1)-designs).
#'
#' Three construction methods are available through `method`:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`"search"` (default)}{A flexible randomized search. Any number of
#'     entries, locations, block sizes, p-rep proportions (`prep_prop`,
#'     `n_duplicate_per_location`), replication levels
#'     (`replications_per_repeated_entry`) and block counts can be used, with
#'     an optional resolvable layout (`resolvable`).}
#'   \item{`"alpha"`}{The partial alpha-array construction of Section 2.1 of
#'     the paper. An alpha-array for `l * m` rows and `2l` replicates is
#'     searched, the `m x 2` rectangles on its diagonal give the two-replicate
#'     design for the p-rep entries of each location, and half of the
#'     remaining elements of each column are deleted (Section 2.2) so that the
#'     design is a (0,1)-design. Every entry is duplicated at exactly one
#'     location, each location is resolvable with two replicates of `s`
#'     blocks, and each block holds `m` p-rep entries; the final block size is
#'     `(l + 1) m / 2` (blocks of the two replicates differ by one plot when
#'     this is not an integer).}
#'   \item{`"alpha2"`}{The augmented alpha(2)-array construction of
#'     Section 2.4, for even `m` and an odd number of blocks per replicate
#'     `s`. Every block has `(l + 1) m / 2` plots.}
#' }
#' For the algebraic methods, `m` is set with `n_prep_per_block` (or chosen as
#' the largest value whose blocks fit in `block_size`), the number of blocks
#' and of duplicated entries follow from the construction, and
#' `replications_per_repeated_entry` must be 2. When the number of entries is
#' not a multiple of the array size, the surplus array positions are dropped
#' as dummy entries, so some blocks are one plot smaller.
#' `augmented_prep_parameters()` lists the feasible parameter sets.
#'
#' The incomplete block structure is independent from the field geometry. By
#' default, `field_cols` lays the ordered plots into rows and columns. For a
#' rectangular block layout, use `rows_per_block` and `blocks_per_row` to place
#' multiple blocks side by side within each location.
#'
#' @param treatments Character vector of entry names.
#' @param locations Character vector of location names.
#' @param method Construction method: `"search"`, `"alpha"` or `"alpha2"`
#'   (see Details).
#' @param block_size Maximum final incomplete block size. Can be a single
#'   integer or a named vector indexed by location (the algebraic methods use
#'   its smallest value). Actual block sizes may differ by one plot when
#'   totals do not divide evenly.
#' @param prep_prop Optional proportion of entries to duplicate per location
#'   (`method = "search"` only). If `NULL`, entries are split across locations
#'   so each entry is duplicated at approximately one location.
#' @param n_duplicate_per_location Optional number of entries duplicated at
#'   each location (`method = "search"` only). Can be a single integer, a
#'   vector matching `locations`, or a named vector indexed by location.
#' @param replications_per_repeated_entry Total number of plots for entries
#'   selected for p-rep replication at a location. The default `2` gives one
#'   base plot plus one extra plot. Can be a single integer or a named vector
#'   indexed by location. Must be 2 for the algebraic methods.
#' @param n_blocks_per_location Optional number of incomplete blocks at each
#'   location (`method = "search"` only). If `NULL`, the number of blocks is
#'   the minimum needed so no block is larger than `block_size`. Can be a
#'   single integer or a named vector indexed by location.
#' @param resolvable Logical (`method = "search"`). If `TRUE`, each location
#'   is laid out as a resolvable design: the blocks are grouped into
#'   `replications_per_repeated_entry` replicates, each replicate holds every
#'   p-rep entry of that location exactly once plus an even share of the
#'   unreplicated entries, and all replicates have the same number of blocks.
#'   If `n_blocks_per_location` is given it must be a multiple of the number
#'   of replicates. Designs from the algebraic methods are always resolvable.
#' @param n_prep_per_block For the algebraic methods, the number `m` of p-rep
#'   entries in every block. If `NULL`, the largest feasible `m` whose blocks
#'   fit in `block_size` is used.
#' @param n_candidates Maximum number of candidate designs (`"search"`) or of
#'   random starting arrays (`"alpha"`, `"alpha2"`) to generate.
#'   `summary$n_candidates_evaluated` reports how many were used.
#' @param n_efficiency_candidates Number of optimal candidates (no entry
#'   repeated within a block, connected locations, and no pair of entries
#'   sharing more than one block) to compare on the average efficiency factor;
#'   the one with the highest efficiency is returned. Use `1` to return the
#'   first optimal candidate. Efficiency is compared for up to 2000 entries.
#' @param seed Optional random seed.
#' @param field_cols Optional number of field columns for row/column layout.
#'   Can be a single integer or a named vector indexed by location.
#' @param rows_per_block Optional number of physical field rows each incomplete
#'   block should occupy. Can be a single integer or a named vector for selected
#'   locations. Must be used with `blocks_per_row` for those locations.
#' @param blocks_per_row Optional number of incomplete blocks to place side by
#'   side in each field row band. Can be a single integer or a named vector for
#'   selected locations. Must be used with `rows_per_block` for those locations.
#' @param serpentine Logical. If `TRUE`, row/column coordinates use serpentine
#'   ordering within each location.
#' @param output_file Optional tab-delimited output file for the complete
#'   design.
#'
#' @details
#' With `method = "search"`, the p-rep plots of every location are spread
#' evenly over its blocks, and the p-rep entries are placed so that they link
#' all blocks of the location (the location is connected), so entry effects
#' can also be estimated from each location on its own. A warning is given
#' when there are too few p-rep plots to connect the blocks. After the random
#' greedy search, the best candidates are improved by swapping plots between
#' blocks to remove pairs of entries that share more than one block.
#'
#' For all methods, `summary` reports the maximum pairwise concurrence, the
#' number of locations whose blocks are not connected, and the average
#' efficiency factor `efficiency_factor` of the block design (Section 2.3 of
#' the paper; higher is better), which can be used to compare designs.
#' Entry labels, block order within replicates and plot order within blocks
#' are randomized.

#' Analyze an augmented p-rep design
#'
#' Fits the fixed-effects incomplete-block model:
#' `y = mean + location + block(location) + genotype + error`.
#' For resolvable designs (a `replicate` column with more than one replicate
#' per location) the model is
#' `y = mean + location + replicate(location) + block(replicate, location) +
#' genotype + error`. With `genotype_by_location = "fixed"` (or `TRUE`) a
#' fixed genotype-by-location interaction is added after genotypes; the error
#' is then estimated only from the p-rep entries, as in a per-location
#' analysis with pooled error (Williams, Piepho and Whitaker, 2011,
#' Section 3). With `genotype_by_location = "random"` the interaction is a
#' random effect, as recommended by the paper when locations are a sample of
#' environments, and the model is fitted by REML with 'lme4'.
#' Sums of squares are sequential, in the order above. Degrees of freedom in
#' the formatted ANOVA are those estimable from the observed (non-missing)
#' plots, so F-tests stay valid when plots are missing. For a complete,
#' connected design they equal the design formulas reported in `anova_df`,
#' which use total plots (`n`), locations (`l`), incomplete blocks (`b`), and
#' genotypes (`v`). Terms with a single level in the data (for example the
#' location term in a single-location trial) are left out of the model and
#' shown with 0 df.
#'
#' @param data A complete augmented p-rep design data frame, usually
#'   `design$design` from `augmented_prep_design()`, or an object returned by
#'   `augmented_prep_design()`, with a response column added.
#' @param response Name of the numeric response column.
#' @param genotype_col Name of the genotype/treatment column.
#' @param location_col Name of the location column.
#' @param block_col Name of the incomplete block column. Block numbers may
#'   repeat across locations; blocks are treated as nested within locations.
#' @param entry_type_col Optional entry type column. Used only for genotype
#'   summaries.
#' @param extra_repeat_col Optional extra-repeat indicator column. Used only
#'   for genotype summaries.
#' @param repeated_at_col Optional column identifying where each entry is
#'   repeated. Used only for genotype summaries.
#' @param control_col Optional control flag column. Used only for genotype
#'   summaries.
#' @param replicate_col Optional replicate (superblock) column. When present
#'   and a location has more than one replicate, replicates nested within
#'   locations are fitted, and blocks are nested within replicates. Set to
#'   `NULL` to ignore it.
#' @param genotype_by_location Genotype-by-location interaction in a
#'   multi-location analysis: `"none"` (default, or `FALSE`), `"fixed"` (or
#'   `TRUE`), or `"random"` (needs the 'lme4' package). With `"fixed"`,
#'   adjusted means are averaged over locations. With `"random"`, adjusted
#'   means are the genotype BLUEs from the mixed model, `variance_components`
#'   gives the REML estimates, and the ANOVA table is the fixed-interaction

#'
#' @section Adjusted means:
#' Genotype effects are fixed, so the adjusted means are best linear unbiased
#' estimates (BLUEs): the genotype effect plus the average location and block
#' effect over all observed plots, i.e. the expected value of the genotype in
#' an average plot of the trial. They remove the advantage or penalty of the
#' blocks and locations where each entry happened to be planted, so use
#' `adjusted_mean` (not `raw_mean`) to rank and select entries. Differences
#' between adjusted means are the same as those from `emmeans` on the fitted
#' model. With `genotype_by_location = "fixed"` the genotype-by-location
#' effects are averaged over locations, weighting each location by its share
#' of the observed plots. With `"random"`, standard errors come from the
#' REML covariance of the fixed effects, which includes the
#' genotype-by-location variance; `lsd_5pct` uses the error df of the
#' fixed-interaction model as an approximation.
#'
#' @section Per-location analysis:
#' Williams, Piepho and Whitaker (2011) suggest analysing each location with
#' an incomplete-block model. Pass the rows of one location, e.g.
#' `analyze_augmented_prep_design(data[data$location == "A", ], "yield")`.
#' `augmented_prep_design()` keeps the blocks of every location connected,
#' so this is estimable whenever the location has enough p-rep plots.

#' Plot an augmented p-rep design grid
#'
#' Draws one field map per location for an augmented p-rep design.
#'
#' A p-rep design has no check plots: at each location some entries are
#' planted more than once (repeated entries), and these replace the checks
#' for estimating the error and the block effects. By default the map
#' colours the repeated entries (orange, names in bold) and the entries with
#' a single plot at that location (light grey). Thick black lines outline the
#' incomplete blocks; in resolvable designs a thick blue line separates the
#' replicates, which are labelled at the right. A caption under each map
#' explains this.
#'
#' @param design An object returned by `augmented_prep_design()` or its
#'   `design` data frame.
#' @param locations Optional character vector of locations to plot. Defaults
#'   to all locations in design order.
#' @param label Cell label to show. Use `"all_entries"`, `"entry_type"`,
#'   `"repeated_at"`, `"block"`, `"replicate"`, or `"none"`.
#' @param fill Cell coloring variable. Use `"entry_type"`,
#'   `"is_extra_repeat"`, `"repeated_at"`, `"block"`, or `"replicate"`.
#' @param show_plot_labels Logical. If `TRUE`, labels are printed inside
#'   cells unless `label = "none"`.
#' @param show_block_labels Logical. If `TRUE`, block numbers are printed.
#'   Defaults to `FALSE` so block labels do not overlap accession labels.
#' @param block_label_position Position for block labels when
#'   `show_block_labels = TRUE`. Use `"background"` for a faint watermark
#'   behind accession labels or `"center"` for a regular center label.
#' @param label_cex Optional text size for plot-cell labels.
#' @param block_label_cex Optional text size for block labels.
#' @param block_label_col Color for block labels.
#' @param block_lwd Line width for block boundaries.
#' @param main Optional plot title. If multiple locations are plotted, a
#'   single value is combined with the location name; a vector matching the
#'   number of locations is used panel by panel.
#' @param legend Logical. If `TRUE`, draw a legend for cell colors.
#' @param caption Logical. If `TRUE`, print a short explanation of the
#'   colours and lines under each map.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to `graphics::plot.window()`.
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns the plotted design data frame with internal
#'   plotting coordinates.
