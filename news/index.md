# Changelog

## breedtools 0.1.0

- First CRAN release.
- [`design_options()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/design_options.md):
  the field dimensions are now `rows_in_field` and `cols_in_field`, the
  same names as in its result and in
  [`augmented_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_row_column_design.md).
  `rows` and `cols` still work, with a deprecation warning. When
  possible, the first augmented row-column option has square blocks of
  `n_checks` x `n_checks` (e.g. 3 x 3 blocks for three checks), flagged
  by the new column `square_check_blocks`; other block shapes are still
  listed. With one known dimension, the square field is also tested.
- Documentation website (pkgdown) with every function grouped by task,
  and a grouped list of all functions with examples in the README.
- Names saved in Breedbase contain only letters, digits, “*”, ”-” and
  ”.”: in trial, plot, new folder and analysis names, spaces and
  characters such as % \$ ( ) { } \[ \]  / \< \> \* become ”*”
  (e.g. location “Alcobaca (BA)” gives trial
  “EMBRAPA_2026_Alcobaca_BA”). Accession and location names are kept,
  existing folders are used as they are, and trials can still be looked
  up by the original name.
- [`save_breedbase_analysis()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_analysis.md)
  has `folder` and `create_folder`: the analysis is put in a folder of
  the program (as the website’s “Move to folder”), instead of directly
  in the breeding program.
- New
  [`breedbase_check()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_check.md)
  checks the location(s) and every entry and check (as accessions) in
  Breedbase before a design is built, plus the program, folder and trial
  name when given. All problems are listed together with close matches
  (e.g. “ibadan” -\> “Ibadan”).
  [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  now reports location and accession problems together too.
- Breedbase searches work on slow servers: accessions are searched 25 at
  a time and a batch that times out (HTTP 504/502/503/429) is split and
  tried again, with a line after each batch (names done, percent, time).
  Accessions found are remembered for the R session, so
  [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  after
  [`breedbase_check()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_check.md)
  does not search them again.
- [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  survives server timeouts when writing: after a timeout it checks
  whether the folder, trial or plots were created before trying again
  (no duplicates), and a re-run continues a save that was cut off (an
  existing folder is used; a trial without plots gets its plots).
- [`breedbase_check()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_check.md)
  says plainly when the trial already exists (“choose another
  trial_name”), and that an existing folder is fine: the trial is saved
  inside it.
  [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  also uses a folder that Breedbase reports as existing when it tries to
  create it.
- The `folder` of
  [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  is optional: without it the trial is saved directly in the breeding
  program.
- [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  sends the `germplasmDbId` of each accession with the plots, which
  Breedbase requires (“Verify Germplasm Id.” error before).
- New
  [`save_breedbase_phenotypes()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_phenotypes.md)
  saves phenotypic data to Breedbase by plot name and trait name (wide:
  one column per trait, or long: trait and value columns; optional time
  stamps for repeated measurements). Plots and traits are checked first,
  values are sent in batches (surviving server timeouts) and read back
  to verify. New
  [`phenotype_template()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/phenotype_template.md)
  makes the phenotyping sheet with the Breedbase plot names of a design.
- Analysis results to Breedbase. First stage:
  [`first_stage_values()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/first_stage_values.md)
  gives one value per field plot (adjusted mean of the genotype + plot
  residual, design and spatial effects removed) and
  [`save_breedbase_first_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_first_stage.md)
  saves it on the field plots as its own trait: the measured trait
  composed with a statistic (“fresh root yield\|Adjusted Means from
  Spatial Correction using SpATS R”), found or created by
  [`breedbase_adjusted_trait()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_adjusted_trait.md).
  Second stage:
  [`second_stage_values()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/second_stage_values.md)
  collects the genotype adjusted means and
  [`save_breedbase_analysis()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_analysis.md)
  saves them as a Breedbase analysis, like the Breedbase mixed-models
  tool.
- [`analyze_resolvable_row_column()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_resolvable_row_column.md)
  now returns `plot_results` with the fitted values and plot residuals.
- New
  [`analyze_two_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_two_stage.md):
  two-stage analysis of a multi-location trial for every design
  (augmented row-column, augmented p-rep, resolvable row-column), with a
  SpATS spatial stage 1 (default) or the design’s own model, and the
  weighted stage 2 of
  [`analyze_augmented_prep_two_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_prep_two_stage.md).
- New
  [`compare_first_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/compare_first_stage.md):
  raw against first-stage adjusted plot values per location
  (correlation, spread, change in genotype ranking), with raw and
  adjusted field maps.
- New
  [`find_outliers()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/find_outliers.md)
  and
  [`remove_outliers()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/remove_outliers.md):
  IQR rule (multiplier 1.5 by default) within each location; removed
  values are set to `NA` and listed by plot.
- New
  [`plot_trait()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/plot_trait.md):
  histogram and field map of a trait per location, with outliers
  circled.
- [`analyze_augmented_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_row_column_design.md)
  returns `adjusted_means_vcov`; with `spatial = TRUE` or random
  effects, `plot_results` residuals now come from that model (they came
  from the fixed model before).
- [`breedbase_login()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_login.md)
  has `site_username` / `site_password` for test sites with an extra web
  password in front of the website (BrAPI works without it, the trait
  composer and analyses need it); a clear message says so. Usually not
  needed: at login, when a site’s web pages ask for a password, the
  Breedbase login is tried there and used if it works.
- [`breedbase_adjusted_trait()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_adjusted_trait.md)
  finds an existing adjusted trait through BrAPI first, so the first
  stage needs no web page when the trait exists.
- Breedbase’s BrAPI upload does not refresh the phenotype cache that its
  trial pages and search wizard read, so saved values did not show
  there.
  [`save_breedbase_phenotypes()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_phenotypes.md)
  and
  [`save_breedbase_first_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_first_stage.md)
  now ask Breedbase to refresh it; new
  [`breedbase_refresh()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_refresh.md)
  does it on demand.
- No fixed Breedbase terms: the statistic of first- and second-stage
  results is chosen from the server’s own statistic terms (new
  [`breedbase_statistics()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_statistics.md)
  lists them), a given statistic is checked against the server, and
  composed traits are matched by their components. A model type unknown
  to the server gives a clear message.
- [`save_breedbase_analysis()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_analysis.md)
  uses the same upload as Breedbase’s “Upload analysis” form (name,
  description, protocol, breeding program, statistic, optional time
  terms) with Breedbase’s model type for uploaded results, and has
  `level = "plot"` (“Analysis of: plots”): first-stage values become an
  analysis with one plot per field plot, linked by Breedbase to the
  field trial.
- Statistics are checked against the Breedbase statistics ontology
  (`cxgn_statistics.obo` from the Breedbase source, included in the
  package): a statistic must be a real SGNSTAT term, a given id must
  belong to the given name, and misspelled names get suggestions;
  [`breedbase_statistics()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_statistics.md)
  lists the terms without a server.
- Sites whose web pages need their own web password (e.g. cassava-test):
  the login asks for it; without it,
  [`save_breedbase_analysis()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase_analysis.md)
  checks everything through BrAPI and writes the file of the website’s
  “Upload analysis” form, printing every form field to fill in.
- New
  [`breedbase_phenotypes()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_phenotypes.md)
  reads the phenotypes of a list of trials and traits from Breedbase
  (plots with accession, rep, block, row, column).
- New
  [`analyze_single_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_single_stage.md):
  all trials in one model (lme4, or SpATS with `spatial = TRUE`: trials
  side by side, each with its own spatial trend), to compare with the
  two-stage analysis.
- `analyze_two_stage(stage1 = "blocks")`: a first stage without a design
  object, for data read from Breedbase;
  [`first_stage_values()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/first_stage_values.md)
  works without a design for such data.
- `add_breedbase_analysis_values(statistic = )` stores values under
  “trait\|statistic”, so several analyses (e.g. two-stage and
  single-stage means) can sit in the same analysis project.
- New
  [`add_breedbase_analysis_values()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/add_breedbase_analysis_values.md)
  adds results (e.g. a second trait) to an analysis already in
  Breedbase, through the phenotype upload of the website: Breedbase
  verifies the file first, and values already stored are not replaced
  unless `overwrite = TRUE`.
- The script has three Breedbase switches (`save_designs`,
  `save_phenotypes`, `save_analyses`), a trial-name prefix and a run tag
  for unique analysis names, and saves analyses only for trials in
  Breedbase.
- New
  [`breedbase_trial_plots()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_trial_plots.md)
  reads the plots of a saved trial;
  `first_stage_values(breedbase_plots = )` checks that the design in R
  is the one saved (same accession at every plot number) and uses the
  saved plot names.
- `scripts/validate_designs.R` is organized in one part per design, each
  from the field plan to the results in Breedbase. See
  `options(breedtools.germplasm_batch)` and
  `options(breedtools.breedbase_timeout)`.
- New
  [`save_breedbase()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/save_breedbase.md)
  saves any design (augmented row-column, p-rep, resolvable row-column)
  as a trial with its plots in a ‘Breedbase’ database through BrAPI v2,
  in a chosen breeding program and folder. It checks the program, folder
  (optionally created), locations, accessions and trial name before
  writing, asks for confirmation, and reads the plots back to verify.
  `dry_run = TRUE` makes all checks without writing. Plot names are made
  automatically as `trialName_accession_block_rep` (`plot_name_pattern`)
  or given by you (`plot_names`), and are checked to be new in the
  database.
  [`breedbase_login()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_login.md)
  logs in without storing the password;
  [`breedbase_programs()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_lists.md),
  [`breedbase_folders()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_lists.md)
  and
  [`breedbase_locations()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/breedbase_lists.md)
  list what exists.
- New resolvable row-column designs (Williams, John and Whitaker, 2006):
  - [`resolvable_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/resolvable_row_column_design.md)
    builds designs for `v <= k * s` treatments in `r` replicates of
    `k x s`, optimizing the row-column, row and column efficiency
    factors and then the spatial (LV + RC) efficiency factor. Latinized
    and t-latinized designs for contiguous replicates, filler plots, and
    improving or laying out an existing design (`start_design`) are
    supported.
  - [`resolvable_row_column_efficiency()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/resolvable_row_column_efficiency.md)
    reports the efficiency factors, the spatial upper bound, the
    AR-model criterion z(X), and treatment neighbour and edge counts.
  - [`analyze_resolvable_row_column()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_resolvable_row_column.md)
    fits the RC, LV + RC and AR + RC models by REML and compares them by
    deviance; long columns of latinized designs can be fitted as fixed.
  - [`plot_resolvable_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/plot_resolvable_row_column_design.md)
    draws the field.
- [`augmented_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_row_column_design.md):
  - Check placement now uses covering Latin rectangles, so every field
    row and column gets a check.
  - Layouts whose effects cannot be estimated, or that leave no error
    degrees of freedom, are rejected.
  - The design is much faster to generate.
- New helpers for checking designs and simulations:
  [`check_setup()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/check_setup.md)
  checks at the start of a script that breedtools, the optional ‘lme4’
  and ‘SpATS’ packages and the output folder are ready,
  [`check_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/check_design.md)
  runs the standard checks of any design and prints `[OK]` / `[FAIL]`
  lines,
  [`check_result()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/check_result.md)
  records a check of your own,
  [`check_section()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/check_section.md)
  groups the following checks,
  [`check_summary()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/check_summary.md)
  reports what was checked by section and what is correct,
  [`check_reset()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/check_reset.md)
  clears the tally (saying how many checks it cleared), and
  [`prediction_accuracy()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/prediction_accuracy.md)
  gives the correlation between adjusted means and known true values.
- New
  [`augmented_row_column_layouts()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_row_column_layouts.md)
  lists every analyzable layout of a field (block sizes and numbers of
  checks), most entry plots first, with optional `n_entries` and
  `min_error_df` filters.
- [`augmented_row_column_capacity()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_row_column_capacity.md)
  reports the error degrees of freedom of a layout, the share of check
  plots, and the row-group and column-group conditions of Piepho and
  Williams (2016).
- Augmented row-column designs now support the full strategy of Piepho
  and Williams (2016): row and column groups of unequal size
  (`rows_per_rowgroup`, `cols_per_colgroup`) and any number of check
  plots per block (`checks_per_block`), giving incomplete blocks or
  extra check replication. The new `method = "optimal"` allocates checks
  by a D-optimal local search that keeps check plots from being
  neighbours (same column in consecutive rows, or same row in
  consecutive columns) and keeps the check allocation balanced: a block
  with at least as many check plots as checks holds every check (extra
  plots repeat checks), an incomplete block holds each check at most
  once, rows and columns of a group get even numbers of check plots, and
  a column (or row) with room for all checks holds every check. Figures
  3 and 4 of Piepho and Williams (2016) are reproduced with all their
  stated properties; `"latin"` keeps the covering Latin rectangle
  construction (now with evenly spaced check rows and columns, and
  polished by swapping rows or columns within groups to remove
  neighbouring checks), and `"auto"` picks it when it applies. `summary`
  reports the D-criterion.
- [`analyze_augmented_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_row_column_design.md)
  can take rows, columns and blocks as random to recover inter-block
  information (`random_blocks = TRUE`), model entries as random with
  fixed checks (`entries = "random"`, BLUPs), or add a spatial P-spline
  surface with ‘SpATS’ (`spatial = TRUE`).
- [`analyze_augmented_row_column_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_row_column_design.md):
  - Degrees of freedom are corrected (rows within row groups `k - gk`,
    columns within column groups `s - gs`), and the ANOVA uses the df
    that are estimable from the observed plots.
  - The model is fitted by absorbing unreplicated entries, so it is fast
    for large fields.
- [`augmented_prep_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_prep_design.md)
  uses a faster candidate search with incremental concurrence scoring.
  The search stops early once an optimal design is found.
- [`augmented_prep_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_prep_design.md)
  follows Williams, Piepho and Whitaker (2011) more closely:
  - p-rep plots are spread evenly over the blocks of each location;
  - the blocks of each location are kept connected by the p-rep entries,
    so each location can be analysed on its own (a warning is given when
    there are too few p-rep plots to do so);
  - a swap-based improvement step removes pairs of entries that share
    more than one block, giving (0,1)-designs for cases such as the
    paper’s six-location trial with blocks of eight; repeated
    concurrences are penalized quadratically, so when a (0,1)-design is
    out of reach the excess is spread over pairs instead of one pair
    meeting at every location, and greedy candidates that put an entry
    twice in a block are repaired instead of discarded;
  - new `resolvable = TRUE` option builds a resolvable design at each
    location (every p-rep entry once per replicate), returned in the new
    `replicate` column;
  - `summary` reports the average efficiency factor
    (`efficiency_factor`) and the number of disconnected locations;
    among optimal candidates the most efficient one is returned
    (`n_efficiency_candidates`).
  - new `method` argument chooses the construction: `"search"`
    (default), `"alpha"` (partial alpha-arrays, Sections 2.1-2.2 of the
    paper) or `"alpha2"` (augmented alpha(2)-arrays, Section 2.4), with
    `n_prep_per_block` for the number of p-rep entries per block (`m`).
- New
  [`analyze_augmented_prep_two_stage()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_prep_two_stage.md):
  two-stage analysis of multi-location p-rep trials. Stage 1 analyses
  each location with its own error variance, either with the
  incomplete-block model or with a spatial P-spline model from the
  suggested ‘SpATS’ package (`stage1 = "spatial"`). Stage 2 combines the
  location means with full or diagonal stage-1 weighting (Möhring and
  Piepho, 2009) and a REML genotype-by-location variance. It reports
  Hartley’s Fmax test of heterogeneous error variances.
- [`analyze_augmented_prep_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_prep_design.md)
  returns the covariance matrix of the adjusted means
  (`$adjusted_means_vcov`).
- Methods `"alpha"` and `"alpha2"` stop searching once further random
  starts no longer help, and warn when no (0,1)-design was found.
- New
  [`augmented_prep_parameters()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/augmented_prep_parameters.md)
  lists the feasible parameter sets of the algebraic constructions (as
  in Table 3 of the paper).
- [`map_environment_groups()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/map_environment_groups.md)
  now uses the same maps as the ‘Breedbase’ Locations page by default
  (`tiles = "breedbase"`): Esri Street, Topographical and Satellite,
  with a switch between them. They need no account or API key and work
  in the RStudio viewer. `tiles` can also be `"street"`, `"topo"`,
  `"satellite"`, `"OpenStreetMap"` or a leaflet provider name.
- [`plot_augmented_prep_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/plot_augmented_prep_design.md)
  draws clearer maps: entries repeated at the location in orange with
  bold names (they replace the checks), single plots in light grey,
  thick black lines around blocks, a blue line and labels for
  replicates, a plain-language legend, a caption explaining the map
  (`caption = TRUE`), and locations in the order of the design. It can
  also colour plots by replicate.
- [`analyze_augmented_prep_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_prep_design.md):
  - Handles single-location trials.
  - Reports df that are estimable when plots are missing.
- [`analyze_augmented_prep_design()`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/reference/analyze_augmented_prep_design.md)
  fits replicates within locations for resolvable designs
  (`replicate_col`) and can add a genotype-by-location interaction,
  fixed (`genotype_by_location = "fixed"`) or random (`"random"`, REML
  via the suggested ‘lme4’ package, with variance components in
  `$variance_components`).
- Both analyses now return adjusted entry means (BLUEs) with standard
  errors (`$adjusted_means`), and report the mean SED and the 5% LSD in
  `$diagnostics`.
- New tutorial,
  [`vignette("breedtools")`](https://solgenomics.github.io/breedtools/articles/breedtools.md),
  covering every design and analysis and the multi-environment tools,
  and an RStudio workflow script in `inst/examples`. The source package
  includes `scripts/validate_designs.R`, a step-by-step tour of every
  design and analysis with simple checks, and
  `scripts/run_all_checks.R`, the full automated validation against the
  published examples, [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html), ‘lme4’
  and simulation.
