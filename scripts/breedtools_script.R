# breedtools: a step-by-step tour of every design and analysis
#
# Run this script section by section in RStudio (Ctrl+Enter line by line, or
# Ctrl+Alt+T for one section; the outline pane lists the sections). Each
# section designs a trial, looks at it, saves the field book, simulates
# yields, analyses them, and ends with a few checks that print
#   [OK]   when the result is what we expect, or
#   [FAIL] when something is wrong.
# Where a method comes from a paper, the checks compare with the published
# numbers.
#
#   0. Setup
#   1. Augmented row-column design (checks, one location)
#   2. Flexible augmented row-column designs (Piepho and Williams, 2016)
#   3. Augmented p-rep design (no checks, several locations)
#   4. p-rep designs built from alpha-arrays (Williams, Piepho and Whitaker, 2011)
#   5. Two-stage analysis of a multi-location trial
#   6. Resolvable row-column design (Williams, John and Whitaker, 2006)
#   7. Multi-environment trials from Breedbase
#   8. Save a design to Breedbase (BrAPI), including agricolae field books
#   9. Summary of the checks
#
# The yields are simulated, so we know the true genotype values and can see
# how well each analysis recovers them.
#
# For the full automated test battery (thousands of checks, used in CI), run
#   Rscript scripts/run_all_checks.R
