# breedtools: a step-by-step tour, one part per trial design
#
# Run it part by part in RStudio (Ctrl+Enter line by line, or Ctrl+Alt+T for
# one section; the outline pane lists the parts). Every design part follows
# the same steps, from the field plan to the results in Breedbase:
#
#   1. plan and generate the design (one randomization per location)
#   2. look at it, and save the field books
#   3. save the trials to Breedbase
#   4. phenotypes: the sheet with the plot names, and the field data
#   5. plot the trait
#   6. find and remove outliers (IQR rule), listing what was removed
#   7. first stage at every location with SpATS, compared with the raw data
#   8. second stage: combine the locations, weighted by precision
#   9. save phenotypes, first stage (plot values) and second stage
#      (genotype means) to Breedbase
#  10. checks: [OK] when a result is what we expect, [FAIL] when not
#
#   0. Setup
#   A. Augmented row-column design (unreplicated entries + checks)
#   B. Flexible augmented row-column layouts (Piepho and Williams, 2016)
#   C. Augmented p-rep design (no checks, several locations)
#   D. p-rep designs from alpha-arrays (Williams, Piepho and Whitaker, 2011)
#   E. Resolvable row-column design (Williams, John and Whitaker, 2006)
#   F. Multi-environment trials from Breedbase files
#   H. From Breedbase trials to analyses (read, outliers, first, second and
#      single stage, store as analyses)
#   G. Summary of the checks
#
# The field data are simulated, so we know the true genotype values and can
# see how well each analysis recovers them. With your own data, read the
# filled phenotyping sheet instead (shown in each part).
#
# For the full automated test battery (used in CI), run
#   Rscript scripts/run_all_checks.R
